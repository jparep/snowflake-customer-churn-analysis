# Snowflake Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using data ingested and processed through Snowflake. The goal is to build a robust data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data into Snowflake for analysis.

## Architecture

The architecture of the project includes the following components:
- **Data Ingestion**: Collecting data from various sources.
- **Data Storage**: Storing raw data in Snowflake.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Performing churn analysis using SQL and other analytical tools.

## Data Sources

The data sources for this project include:
- Customer transaction data
- Customer demographic data
- Customer service interaction data

## ETL Pipeline

The ETL pipeline consists of the following steps:
1. **Extract**: Data is extracted from various sources.
2. **Transform**: Data is cleaned and transformed to fit the analysis requirements.
3. **Load**: Transformed data is loaded into Snowflake tables.

## Analysis

The analysis involves:
- Identifying key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Building predictive models to forecast churn.
- Visualizing churn trends and patterns.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jparep/snowflake-customer-churn-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd snowflake-customer-churn-analysis
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the ETL pipeline and perform analysis, use the following commands:

1. Run the ETL pipeline:
    ```bash
    python etl_pipeline.py
    ```
2. Perform the analysis:
    ```bash
    python analysis.py
    ```
